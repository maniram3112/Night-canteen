ORDER TRACKER FOR NIGHT CANTEEN

ISSUE WITH NIGHT CANTEEN (only for those who are staying at IIT DH)

Everyday people order something from the night canteen and they have to wait a long time for their orders. Also, sometimes we don’t know what menu items are currently available so it would be a waste to go all the way there just to find out that what we want is not even there.
This task is time consuming one and we need to find a
solution for it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM TO SOLVE THE GIVEN PROBLEM

We will create a website to order food from the night
canteen and track its progress.
The interface will contain the following:
1. The first page is login page – for both the admin (the
shopkeeper) and the users (customers inside the
campus)?
2. The user page contains a navigation bar and a
Dashboard.
3. Body of the page shows the availability of the food
which will be updated by the admin time to time, options
for customer to order.
4. The dashboard will show user details, order status and
so on.
5. There will be a payment option, which will show the QR
code and number of the vendor and an OTP will be
generated to initiate the process.
6. This OTP will be used to collect the order.

Features of our website
1. Users can browse all the Categories and Food Items. 
2. They also can order easily from the website.
3. Admin can Manage Admin, Caegories and Food Items
4. Admin can also Manage and Track Food Order and Delivery
